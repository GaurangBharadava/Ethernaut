This project or repo includes all the Ethernaut solution challenges solved by me using foundry framework.

**Note:** In this solution challenge i am not testing the contract but you will see the test file. it is require to commit into the git. Therefore donot take it seriously. If you want to test contract then you are free to do so.


1. Hello Ethurnaut Challenge.
-In this challenge i have written a script for deploying Level0 contract and authenticate the password of the instance which created in the challenge.
